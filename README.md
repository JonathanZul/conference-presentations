# Jonathan Zul Luna's Presentations

> A collection of slides and materials from my academic and professional presentations.

This repository serves as an archive for the presentations I have delivered at conferences, workshops, and other events.

## Repository Structure

Presentations are organized by the primary project they relate to. Within each project folder, you will find subfolders for specific events, named using a `YYYY-MM-DD_EventName` format to keep them chronologically ordered.
